test-certs provides functions that generate temporary SSL certificates for tests.

Its functions generate the certificates as files in a temporary directory

Note: this package depends on [HsOpenSSL][]. It expects the openssl system
libraries to be available on your system; this is usually the case on most
modern linux distributions.

It's intended for use with [warp-tls][] or similar packages

## Example (wai/warp-tls)

```haskell
import Test.Certs.Temp (certificatePath, keyPath, withCertPathsInTmp')
import Network.Wai (Application) -- from package: wai
import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (Settings) -- from package: warp
import Network.Wai.Handler.WarpTLS (runTLS, tlsSettings) -- from package: warp-tls

-- | Like 'runTLS', but with temporary certificates generated by test-certs
runTLS' :: Settings -> Application -> IO ()
runTLS' appSettings app = withCertPathsInTmp' $ \cp -> do
  let tls = tlsSettings (certificatePath cp) (keyPath cp)
  runTLS tls appSettings app

```
